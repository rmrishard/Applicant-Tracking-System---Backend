Development Tips:
Start with the database - Ensure your schema works before building controllers
Build incrementally - Complete one entity fully before moving to the next
Test as you go - Use Postman for API testing, console.log for frontend debugging
Focus on core workflow first - Perfect the candidate → application → hiring flow
Keep it simple - Avoid over-engineering; you can always add features later
Estimated Timeline: 6-7 weeks
Weeks 1-2: Foundation + Authentication
Weeks 3-4: Core functionality
Weeks 5-6: Advanced features + Testing
Week 7: Polish + Deployment
This checklist will give you a fully functional ATS that replaces your Trello workflow with a professional recruitment management system!
