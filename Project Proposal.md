# ATS (Applicant Tracking System) - Project Proposal

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Applicant Tracking System (ATS)
**Technology Stack:** Spring Boot + React + PostgreSQL


## Executive Summary

The ATS project is a comprehensive recruitment management system designed to streamline the hiring process for organizations. This web-based application replaces traditional manual tracking methods (like Trello boards) with a professional, feature-rich platform that manages the entire recruitment lifecycle from job posting to candidate onboarding.

## Problem Statement

Current recruitment processes often rely on:
- Manual tracking using spreadsheets or basic project management tools
- Fragmented communication across multiple platforms (Trello, Teams and Email)
- Lack of centralized candidate database
- Limited analytics and reporting capabilities
- Inefficient collaboration between recruiters and hiring managers

## Solution

The ATS provides a unified platform that addresses these challenges through:

### Core Features
1. **Candidate Management**
   - Centralized candidate database with LinkedIn integration(LinkedIn Integration is a maybe, depending on API availability)
   - Skills tracking and experience management
   - Resume storage

2. **Job Management**
   - Job posting creation and management
   - Status tracking (Open, On Hold, Filled, Cancelled)
   - Priority-based organization
   - Company-specific job assignments

3. **Application Tracking**
   - Kanban-style application board (Trello Familarity)
   - Status progression: Applied → Screening → Interviewing → Offer → Hired/Rejected
   - Duplicate application prevention
   - Rating and feedback system

4. **Communication & Notes**
   - Timeline-based communication tracking
   - Multiple note types (Call, Email, Interview, General)
   - Follow-up scheduling and reminders
   - Collaboration between team members

5. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Application conversion rates
   - Time-to-fill metrics
   - Recruiter performance tracking
   - Dashboard with key recruitment KPIs

6. **Security & Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Recruiter)
   - Secure API endpoints

## Technical Architecture
